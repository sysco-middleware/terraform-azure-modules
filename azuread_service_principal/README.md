`use_existing`
Enabling this behaviour is useful for managing existing service principals that may already be installed in your tenant for Microsoft-published APIs, as it allows you to make changes where permitted, and then also reference them in your Terraform configuration. However, the behaviour of delete operations is also affected - when use_existing is true, Terraform will still attempt to delete the service principal on destroy, although it will not raise an error if the deletion fails (as it often the case for first-party Microsoft applications).
